### Algorithm-Based Ranking Systems: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking
The search engines must execute many tasks very well to provide relevant search
results. Put simplistically, you can think of these as:
* Crawling and indexing trillions of document (pages and files) on the Web
* Responding to user queries by providing lists of relevant pages

#### Crawling and Indexing

The search engines start with a seed set of sites that are known to be very high quality, and then visit the links on each page of those sites to discover other web pages.

**Crawling process:** loading the page, analyzing the content, seeing what other pages the page links to. The search engine would then load those other pages and analyze that content as well. This process repeats over and over again until the crawling process is complete.

The first step in this process is to build an `index` of terms. This is a massive database
that catalogs all the significant terms on each page crawled by the search engine.

#### Retrieval and Ranking
Search engine returns a list of relevant pages on the Web in the order it believes is most likely to satisfy the user. This process requires the search engines to scour their corpus of hundreds of billions of documents and do two things:
* Return only the results that are related to the searcher's query
* Rank the results in order of perceived importance

It is both **relevance** and **importance** that the process of SEO is meant to influence.

#### Evaluating Content on a Web Page
Search engines place a lot of weight on the content of each web page. Search engines do a detailed analysis of each web page they find during their crawl to help make that determination.

Search engine performing a detailed analysis of all the words and phrases that appear on a web page, and then building a map of that data for it (semantic map).

One task the search engines face is judging the value of content.

#### Understanding What Content Search Engines Can “See” on a Web Page
Search engine crawlers and indexing programs are basically software programs. They crawl  web pages, analyze its content, and analyze the way all these pages link to one another. Then they organize this into a series of databases that can respond to a user search query with a highly tuned set of results in a few tenths of a second.

The search engine crawler is most interested in the `HTML text` on the page.
The page `title` is one of the most important factors in ranking a given web page.
Search engines previously used the `meta keywords tag`. Its value is now negligible, as search engines don’t use it anymore. Spending time on meta keywords is not recommended because of the lack of SEO benefit.
The content of a `meta description` tag is not directly used by search engines in their ranking algorithms.

Nonetheless, the `meta description tag` plays a key role, as search engines often use it as a part or all of the description for your page in search results. Time spent on meta descriptions is quite valuable.

A fourth element that search engines read is the `alt` attribute for images.
Another element that search engines read is the `<noscript>` tag.
The `<noscript>` tag should be used only to represent the content of the JavaScript.
